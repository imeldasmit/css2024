"""
The .describe() method is used to generate 
descriptive statistics of a DataFrame or Series. 
It provides a summary of the central tendency, 
dispersion, and shape of the distribution of a dataset. 
It is primarily designed for summarizing numerical data, and 
it provides statistics that are meaningful for quantitative variables.

"""
We can do many things with lists:
* print all the items in the list using [:]
* we can add items to the end of the list using append()
* add items at specific positions using insert()
* remove an item from the list using the remove() function
* check how many variables are in the list using the len()
* print a range of values using [start:end] â€“ just like in excel!
